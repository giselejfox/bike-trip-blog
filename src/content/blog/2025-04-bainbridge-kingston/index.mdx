This trip was marked by the first real warm and sunny day of the year. I took a day off work and headed out because I wanted to try out the Kingston Fast Ferry which, at least during the time of this trip, was only running during the weekdays.

The original plan was to take the fast ferry both ways but unfortunately I misread the ferry times and wound up 2 hours early or one hour late depending on how you look at it.

The Symphony Link stop and the Pioneer Street Link stop are approximately the same amount of distance away from Pier 50, where the ferries load. 
It only takes a quick 5min roll down the hill from either stop to get your ticket.
